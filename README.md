This repository is mererly educational.
I am attending the course: *GENERATIVE AI WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS*,
by AWS and DeepLearning.AI

https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-with-llms

 Deeply understand generative AI, describing the key steps in a typical LLM-based generative AI lifecycle, from data gathering and model selection, to performance evaluation and deployment
- Describe in detail the transformer architecture that powers LLMs, how theyâ€™re trained, and how fine-tuning enables LLMs to be adapted to a variety of specific use cases
- Use empirical scaling laws to optimize the model's objective function across dataset size, compute budget, and inference requirements
- Apply state-of-the art training, tuning, inference, tools, and deployment methods to maximize the performance of models within the specific constraints of your project 
- Discuss the challenges and opportunities that generative AI creates for businesses after hearing stories from industry researchers and practitioners

For each week of learning I am documenting theory and labs.
